                        <h3>We Are The Leaders In Consultancy Projects!</h3>
                        <p>Keen Solutions Ltd provides training, counseling, strategy development, project

                            Keen Solutions operated as Keen Counseling and Training Consultancy
                            registered as a business name for 7 years. In 2015 it was incorporated as a
                            company under the Company’s Act. Though relatively young, Keen Solutions has
                            had an opportunity to carry out several consultancy projects with great success.
                            Keen Solutions draws its strength and expertise from the diverse skill sets of its
                            Consultants.

                        (CEMSTEA). We trained their Drug and Alcohol prevention committee on
                        prevention, counseling and Management. We are their preferred service provider
